# Contribution guide

First off, thank you very much for considering to contribute to this project! 

The following checklist will help you to get started and make sure your contribution can be merged as quickly as possible:

- Before you start working on a feature or fix, **please create an [issue](https://github.com/derkork/godot-statecharts/issues/new) first**. This way we can discuss the implementation and any potential side-effects before you spend time on it. It's no fun to spend hours developing something and then have your PR rejected because it doesn't fit the project goals or because it breaks something else.
- In your PR please make sure you **only change the files that are necessary** for your fix or feature. Changes to unrelated files make it harder to review and merge your PR.
- If you have multiple fixes or features, please **create a separate PR for each**. This makes it easier to review and merge them.
- Please make sure your code is **formatted according to the [GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)**. It may not be your preferred style, but we really don't want to have multiple styles mixed in the codebase.
- Please **rebase your PR on the latest on the `main`** branch before submitting it. This makes it easier to compare the changes and avoids merge conflicts.
