# Frequently Asked Questions

## I installed the plugin but I don't see the state charts nodes!

Make sure you enabled the plugin in the project settings. In the menu go to _Project_ -> _Project Settings_. This opens the project settings dialog. There select the _Plugins_ tab and tick the _Enable_ checkbox near the _Godot State Charts_ plugin.

## Can you backport the library to Godot 3?

I'm afraid not. While it technically would be totally possible to do so, I don't have the bandwidth for maintaining two versions of the library. I prefer to focus on the latest version of Godot, which is currently 4.

## Can I use this library with C#?

Yes, you can. The library is written in GDScript, but it provides a wrapper API for C# as well. Please check the [manual](manual.md) for more information.
